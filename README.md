# Headout API Documentation

**API Version: 1**

The Headout API is implemented as JSON over HTTPS using all four verbs (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE). Every resource, like Product, Booking, or User, has their own URL and are manipulated in isolation. In other words, we've tried to make the API follow the REST principles as much as we can.
